		<h1>My Psi Chi Involvement</h1>

		<p>In 2021, I was accepteed into Psi Chi- The International Honor Society in Psychology. To be accepted, applicants must be in the top 35% of their class and hold a GPA above 3.0. After being a member for a year, I was officially initiated into Psi Chi during the annual Initiation Ceremony that was origianlly postponed due to Covid. As a second semester Junior, I applied to become the President of Psi Chi and was elected by Psi Chi members into presidency for the 2022-2023 school year! I have been serving as the President ever since.</p>

		<p>As the President of Psi Chi, I plan Psych Talks with professors and researchers, coordinate community service events, donation drives, and fundraising events, as well as holding general and Exec Board meetings. I also oversee membership applications and dues. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time so far as Psi Chi President and am proud to be Psi Chi member for life!</p>

	<h2> My Instagram Takeover Post From the UW Psychology Department's Account</h2>

	<p> I was able to "take over" the @UWPSYCH Instagram account for a day. I explained to followers why I joined Psi Chi, what Psi Chi is, what the benefits to being a member are, and why I'm passionate about psychology. I also answered any questions that their followers had!</p>
